# Docker Code Review Checklist

Use this checklist when reviewing Docker configurations.

## Dockerfile Optimization & Multi-Stage Builds
- [ ] Dependencies copied before source code for optimal layer caching
- [ ] Multi-stage builds separate build and runtime environments
- [ ] Production stage only includes necessary artifacts
- [ ] Build context optimized with comprehensive .dockerignore
- [ ] Base image selection appropriate (Alpine vs distroless vs scratch)
- [ ] RUN commands consolidated to minimize layers where beneficial

## Container Security Hardening
- [ ] Non-root user created with specific UID/GID (not default)
- [ ] Container runs as non-root user (USER directive)
- [ ] Secrets managed properly (not in ENV vars or layers)
- [ ] Base images kept up-to-date and scanned for vulnerabilities
- [ ] Minimal attack surface (only necessary packages installed)
- [ ] Health checks implemented for container monitoring

## Docker Compose & Orchestration
- [ ] Service dependencies properly defined with health checks
- [ ] Custom networks configured for service isolation
- [ ] Environment-specific configurations separated (dev/prod)
- [ ] Volume strategies appropriate for data persistence needs
- [ ] Resource limits defined to prevent resource exhaustion
- [ ] Restart policies configured for production resilience

## Image Size & Performance
- [ ] Final image size optimized (avoid unnecessary files/tools)
- [ ] Build cache optimization implemented
- [ ] Multi-architecture builds considered if needed
- [ ] Artifact copying selective (only required files)
- [ ] Package manager cache cleaned in same RUN layer

## Development Workflow Integration
- [ ] Development targets separate from production
- [ ] Hot reloading configured properly with volume mounts
- [ ] Debug ports exposed when needed
- [ ] Environment variables properly configured for different stages
- [ ] Testing containers isolated from production builds

## Networking & Service Discovery
- [ ] Port exposure limited to necessary services
- [ ] Service naming follows conventions for discovery
- [ ] Network security implemented (internal networks for backend)
- [ ] Load balancing considerations addressed
- [ ] Health check endpoints implemented and tested
